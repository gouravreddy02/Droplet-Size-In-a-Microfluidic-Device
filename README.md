# Droplet-Size-In-a-Microfluidic-Device

Machine learning models using multivariate regression model, XGBoost, random forest are developed to analyse the relationship between viscosity and flow rate thereby determine droplet size.
Compared these three models to gain insights into the factors affecting droplet formation
